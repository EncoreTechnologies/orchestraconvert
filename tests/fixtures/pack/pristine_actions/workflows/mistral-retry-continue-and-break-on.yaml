        A sample workflow that demonstrates how to handle rollback and retry on error. 
        In this example, the workflow will error and then continue to retry until the file 
        /tmp/done exists. A parallel task will wait for some time before creating the
        file. When completed, /tmp/done will be deleted.

        init:
            action: core.local cmd="rm -f /tmp/done"
