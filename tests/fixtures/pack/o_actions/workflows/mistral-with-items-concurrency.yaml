  A sample workflow that demonstrates how to set the concurrency option
  in with-items to throttle the number of action executions that get
  run simultaneously. Currently in this release, the concurrency option
  does not work with YAQL expression.
input:
  - cmd
  - count
tasks:
  repeat:
    with:
      items: i in <% list(range(0, ctx().count)) %>
      concurrency: 2
    action: core.local
    input:
      cmd: <% ctx().cmd %>; sleep 3
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        publish:
          - result: <% result().select(ctx().stdout) %>
